# AOTC-Misc-Mod-Patches
patches for the Ambition of the Cosmic [continued] mod. 


Currently this is a lot of XML patching I am working on to get AOTC to work with other mods. 

to reduce load, I am starting with SOS2 and will expand to other mods after I get more of SOS2 finished. 


Current patch plans:
A Dog Said
Dubs bad hygene
some of the Vanilla Expanded suite, haven't decided which ones yet.



I may add other mods depending on how much time I have.
