# AOTC-Misc-Mod-Patches</br>
patches for the Ambition of the Cosmic [continued] mod. </br>


Currently this is a lot of XML patching I am working on to get AOTC to work with other mods. </br>

to reduce load, I am starting with SOS2 and will expand to other mods after I get more of SOS2 finished. 


Current patch plans:</br>
A Dog Said</br>
Dubs bad hygene</br>
some of the Vanilla Expanded suite, haven't decided which ones yet.</br>



I may add other mods depending on how much time I have.
